	<p>RSS Morse periodically reads an RSS feed (commmonly a news feed) and tranlates it into International or American Morse Code, which is output as beep or click/clack sounds, or to a physical telegraph sounder connected to a serial port. This brief document will hopefully be all you need to get going.</p>
	<p><span class="yellowbg">Hover the mouse over the controls on the window to get hints on what they do.</span></p>
	<h2>Quick Start</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Select the &quot;topstories&quot; feed URL.</li>
		<li>Set the code speed you want.</li>
		<li>Select Tone, Spark Gap, or Sounder.</li>
		<li>Select International or American code.</li>
		<li>Click Start and you should start to hear the Morse code for Yahoo! top stories.</li>
	</ol>
	<p><span class="yellowbg">If the program crashes when trying to make sounds, disable DirectX. See <a href="#sndcfg">Sound Configuration - Troubleshooting below</a></span>.</p>
<h2><img src="big_rss.png" alt="RSS" width="32" height="32" hspace="8" align="absmiddle">RSS Feeds and URLs</h2>
	<p>RSS feeds contain digests of articles, most often news articles. It's beyond the scope of this document to describe RSS itself, how to use RSS, how to find RSS feeds, etc. Start with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS" target="_blank">Wikipedia article on RSS</a> if you need info and go from there. RSS Morse was tested with Yahoo! RSS News feeds. It comes pre-set with several of these feeds. The Yahoo! feeds are clean copies of Associated Press, Reuters, etc. news wire services, not cluttered with junk and verbal decoration. I suggest you start with these. The Feed URL list is pre-filled with a few Yahoo! RSS feeds and a &quot;Top 100 words&quot; practice feed from my web site. Of course you can type in your own URLs. If you actually <em>use</em> a feed you typed in, it will be remembered in the list. Up to the latest 16 feeds used are remembered. <span class="alert">If you want to reset the list to the original set, right click and select <strong>Reset to original list</strong></span>.</p>
	<p>You can find a  list of Yahoo! feeds on the <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/page/rss" target="_blank">Yahoo! RSS News Feeds page</a> (there's a hot-link to that page on the RSS Morse main window!). To use one of these feeds, click on its RSS icon <img src="rss3.gif" alt="rss" title="Right click and copy link/shortcut for feed URL" width="16" height="17" border="0" align="absmiddle">. You'll see a new browser tab or window full of &quot;stuff&quot;. Never mind that, just copy the URL from the address box at the top of the browser and paste it into the <strong>Feed URL</strong> box at the top of RSS Morse.</p>
	<p>There's sort of an art to discovering the actual feed URL for RSS feeds. Sometimes it's enough to right-click on the RSS icon and select Copy Link or Copy Shortcut (depending on your browser). Looking at the bottom status area of your browser while hovering over a feed icon is another trick. Here are some other news-type RSS sources:</p>
	<p><a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/fronts/RSS?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME" target="_blank"><strong>Associated Press</strong></a> - The real deal, but note that Yahoo! combines AP, Reuters, AFP, and other newswires<br>
	<a href="http://www.upi.com/rss/" target="_blank"><strong>United Press International</strong></a> - Another classic newswire service<br>
	<a href="http://www.reuters.com/tools/rss" target="_blank"><strong>Reuters</strong></a> - Brisith newswire service, more world-oriented than the above US-centric services <br>
		<a href="http://www.cnn.com/services/rss/" target="_blank"><strong>CNN News</strong></a> - These work well in RSS Morse<br>
	<a href="http://www.foxnews.com/rss/index.html" target="_blank"><strong>Fox News</strong></a> - Not so good, too much bulleted hyperlink text follows the real news. </p>
<p><span class="yellowbg">Not all RSS feeds will be usable in RSS Morse!</span></p>
	<h2><img src="twitter_logo.png" alt="Twitter" width="98" height="22" hspace="8" align="absmiddle">and Authenticated Feeds</h2>
	<p>You can monitor your Twitter feed with RSS Morse. To discover your Twitter RSS feed URL, find the little RSS icon  <img src="rss3.gif" alt="rss" title="Right click and copy link/shortcut for feed URL" width="16" height="17" border="0" align="absmiddle"> at the bottom of the right column on your Twitter home page. Click it and you'll end up seeing your feed URL in the address box of your browser. It will look like</p>
	<p> <span class="fixed"><strong>http://twitter.com/statuses/friends_timeline/<span style="color:#00C">nnnnnnn</span>.rss</strong></span></p>
	<p>where the <em>nnnnnnn</em> is your Twitter user ID. A personal Twitter RSS feed requires <em>authentication</em> via username/password. RSS Morse can handle this if you add your Twitter username and password to the feed URL like this:</p>
	<p class="fixed"><strong>http://<span style="color:#00C;">username:password@</span>twitter.com/statuses/friends_timeline/nnnnnnn.rss</strong></p>
	<h3>Other Twitter Tricks</h3>
	<p>The above is only one of several ways to get RSS data from Twitter. If you substitute <span class="fixed">home_timeline</span> for <span class="fixed">friends_timeline</span> above, you'll get your timeline including re-tweets. If you substitute <span class="fixed">mentions</span> for <span class="fixed">friends_timeline</span> above, you'll get tweets that mention you (@username). If you append <span class="fixed">?count=n</span> to the end, only the <em>n</em> most recent items (timeline or mentions) will be grabbed. WIthout this the default is count=20. Remember that any tweet (article) that has been sent out by RSS Morse won't get repeated for Article Age minutes. </p>
	<p><span class="alert">Don't try </span><span class="fixed">public_timeline</span><span class="alert"> ... it has lots of posts which are written in other alphabets or character sets (Chinese, etc.).</span></p>
	<h3>Why Twitter?</h3>
	<p>Even if you don't	use Twitter, it's a useful way to get news of multiple specialized topics. Set up a special Twitter account just for RSS Morse. Then &quot;follow&quot; one or more Twitter timelines like <a href="http://twitter.com/nasa" target="_blank">@NASA</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/FoxBusiness" target="_blank">@FoxBusiness</a>, or <a href="http://twitter.com/dxzone" target="_blank">@dxzone</a>. Most interesting Twitter timelines are low-bandwidth so follow more than one to get a decent amount of traffic. Once you've set this Twitter account up and have followed your choices, use the instructions above to get the RSS feed for RSS Morse.</p>
	<h3>Authenticated Feeds in General</h3>
	<p>The above is an example of using an <em>authenticated</em> RSS feed. Prefixing the domain name with <span class="fixed" style="color:#00C;">username:password@</span> will cause RSS Morse to send your username and password with all of its requests for feed data. You can use this with any feed that requires a login.</p>
	<h2>Article Control</h2>
<p>Each time an RSS feed is read, it supplies a bunch of &quot;recent&quot; articles. RSS Morse has some filtering to prevent the same articles from being seen &quot;too often&quot;. That's what the <strong>Story Age</strong> setting does. The default setting of 120 (minutes) means the same story won't be sent via Morse unless it hasn't been seen for two hours. The Clear Cache button immediately deletes all to the &quot;seen&quot; titles instead of waiting for each to expire. </p>
<p>The <strong>Poll Interval</strong> sets the time (minutes) between fetches of the articles from the RSS feed. If you set this to many minutes, you'll get large batches of messages in Morse at once (like when the Start button is first clicked). If you set this to a short interval like 5 minutes, you'll tend to get small batches of messages more or less in real time. </p>
	<h2>Morse Code Control</h2>
	<p>Besides the obvious selector for International versus American Morse code, you can also control the speed (words per minute). The generated American Morse code has timing nuances that should make it sound quite natural. Timing of American code is much more &quot;human&quot;. Thanks to Les Kerr (the <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~morsekob/" target="_parent">MorseKOB</a> author) for the algorithms that make American code sound natural to experienced landline telegraphers.	</p>
	<h3>Split-Speed (Farnsworth) Timing</h3>
	<p>There are separate controls for code speed (the overall WPM rate) and character speed (the wpm equivalent at which the characters are sent). By setting the character speed higher than the word speed, additional space is inserted between characters and words. This is useful when learning Morse Code. The split-speed timing for International Morse mode is precise, the Code Speed really sets the actual overall &quot;PARIS&quot; (also &quot;MORSE&quot; by the way!) algorithm words-per-minute, even when the character speed is set higher. For American Morse, the Code WPM will not be precise. The split speed timing algorithm is a tradeoff between complexity (and interpretation) and accuracy. Just adjust each speed to your liking and don't put too much faith in the actual WPM read from the Code Speed control.</p>
	<h2>Sound Output</h2>
	<p>You can select to have CW radio tone, old-time CW spark gap tone, or telegraph sounder output. <span class="alert">Selecting <strong>Telegraph Sounder</strong> also changes the format of the Morse Code output</span>. Telegraph sounds cause the output messages (e.g., news summaries) to be in the format of a telegram with old-fashioned date/time. <strong>CW Radio Tone</strong> and <strong>CW Spark Gap </strong>cause the messages to be in the format of a radio message. </p>
	<p>If you select <strong>CW Radio Tone</strong>, clicking the up and down arrow in the <strong>Tone Freq</strong>. box will play a short tone at the new frequency. If you select <strong>CW Spark Gap</strong> you can cycle through the available spark gap sounds. If you select <strong>Telegraph Sounder</strong>, you can cycle through the available sounder sounds in the same way.</p>
	<p>At speeds above 30 wpm, the telegraph sounds can start to sound mushy, especially if you are not using DirectX (see <a href="#sndcfg">Sound (and Timing) Configuration</a> below). This is a limitation in the speed of the sound playing in Windows.</p>
	<h2>Connecting an External Sounder</h2>
	<p>First you need to make up an interface circuit which uses the serial port's Request to Send (RTS) pin to control the current loop that drives the sounder. You can find out more at Les Kerr's <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~morsekob/morsekob.htm#AppendixD" target="_blank">MorseKOB tutorial Appendix D</a>, and at the <a href="http://www.mrx.com.au/images/cwcom_help.htm#Morse Key Cable" target="_blank">end of the CW Communicator manual</a>. Once you have the sounder interface connected, in RSS Morse, select your COM port and click the little blank button to the right of the Use check box. Your sounder should click/clack 4 times. If this works, you're all set. Check the <strong>Use</strong> box, and you'll see the sound output items become disabled. Morse will be sent only to your external sounder.</p>
	<h2><a name="sndcfg"></a>Sound (and Timing) Configuration - Troubleshooting</h2>
	<p>By default RSS Morse uses Microsoft's DirectX sound to produce the audio sounds. This produces the most consistent and accurate sound timing. On some systems DirectX may not work, causing the program to crash when it tries to produce sounds. Before giving up on DirectX, make sure you have the latest DirectX End-User Runtime update (<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/179113" target="_blank">available from Microsoft here</a>). If that doesn't work, then you probably have an old, cheap, or unusual sound adapter that can't be used with DirectX. In that case, click on the <strong>Sound Cfg</strong> link and turn off <strong>DirectX</strong> in the popup window. Now try the program again.</p>
	<p>If you have a slow system, and particularly if you are not using DirectX, you may need to adjust the timing for your computer's speed using the <strong>Timing Comp</strong> setting, also in the <strong>Sound Cfg</strong> popup window. The <strong>Timing Comp</strong> setting needs some explanation: On slower systems, the non-DirectX sound player takes some time to start up. This time subtracts from the computed time for the &quot;mark&quot; symbols (dits and dahs) and adds to the computed time between mark symbols (&quot;spaces&quot;). The effect on a slower system is that the marks will be too short and the spaces will be too long. The <strong>Timing Comp</strong> setting sets the number of milliseconds that will be added to the marks and subtracted from the spaces, allowing for the sound player latency. On a fast system 0 or 1 will be fine. You may need to set 8 or more on a slow notebook, or even more on a dog-slow netbook. </p>
	<p class="note"><strong>Tip:</strong> To adjust RSS Morse for your system, use a sound/audio editor like <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Audacity</a> (a free program) to display the output of RSS Morse. Use CW Tones, and set the speed to 30WPM, International code. This should produce 40ms marks and 40ms spaces between marks (within a character). Set up your Windows Sound Recording to use Stereo Mix as the sound source. Now run RSS Morse and capture at least 30 seconds of sound output. You will clearly see the marks and spaces. Use the program's time-ruler to measure the marks and spaces. Adjust the <strong>Timing Comp</strong> until your code is timed correctly.</p>
	<h2>Administrivia</h2>
	<p>RSS Morse was developed by Robert B. Denny. You can contact me at <a href="mailto:rdenny@dc3.com" target="_blank">rdenny@dc3.com</a>. </p>
	<p>The original spark gap sound is thanks to John S. Belrose on <a href="http://www.hammondmuseumofradio.org/spark.html" target="_blank">The sounds of a Spark Transmitter: Telegraphy and Telephony</a>. I did some audio processing to create the lower pitch sounds.</p>
	<p>Thanks to Les Kerr, the <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~morsekob/" target="_blank">MorseKOB</a> author, and John Samin, author of <a href="http://www.mrx.com.au/d_cwcom.htm" target="_blank">CW Communicator</a>, for help in getting this and other Morse code tools going. </p>
