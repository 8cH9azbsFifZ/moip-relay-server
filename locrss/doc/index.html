	<p>RSS Morse periodically reads an RSS feed (commmonly a news feed) and tranlates it into International or American Morse Code, which is output as beep or click/clack sounds, or to a physical telegraph sounder connected to a serial port. This brief document will hopefully be all you need to get going.</p>
	<p><span class="yellowbg">Hover the mouse over the controls on the window to get hints on what they do.</span></p>
	<h2>Quick Start</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Select the &quot;topstories&quot; feed URL.</li>
		<li>Set the code speed you want.</li>
		<li>Select Tone or Sounder.</li>
		<li>Select International or American code.</li>
		<li>Click Start and you should start to hear the Morse code for Yahoo! top stories.</li>
	</ol>
	<h2>RSS Feeds and URLs</h2>
	<p>RSS feeds contain digests of articles, most often news articles. It's beyond the scope of this document to describe RSS itself, how to use RSS, how to find RSS feeds, etc. Start with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS" target="_blank">Wikipedia article on RSS</a> if you need info and go from there. RSS Morse was tested with Yahoo! RSS News feeds. It comes pre-set with several of these feeds. The Yahoo! feeds are clean copies of Associated Press, Reuters, etc. news wire services, not cluttered with junk and verbal decoration. I suggest you start with these. The Feed URL list is pre-filled with a few Yahoo! RSS feeds and a &quot;Top 100 words&quot; practice feed from my web site. Of course you can type in your own URLs. If you actually <em>use</em> a feed you typed in, it will be remembered in the list. Up to the latest 16 feeds used are remembered.</p>
	<p>You can find a  list of Yahoo! feeds on the <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/page/rss" target="_blank">Yahoo! RSS News Feeds page</a> (there's a hot-link to that page on the RSS Morse main window!). To use one of these feeds, click on its RSS icon <img src="rss3.gif" alt="rss" title="Right click and copy link/shortcut for feed URL" width="16" height="17" border="0" align="absmiddle">. You'll see a new browser tab or window full of &quot;stuff&quot;. Never mind that, just copy the URL from the address box at the top of the browser and paste it into the <strong>Feed URL</strong> box at the top of RSS Morse.</p>
	<p>There's sort of an art to discovering the actual feed URL for RSS feeds. Sometimes it's enough to right-click on the RSS icon and select Copy Link or Copy Shortcut (depending on your browser). Looking at the bottom status area of your browser while hovering over a feed icon is another trick.</p>
	<p><span class="yellowbg">Not all RSS feeds will be usable in RSS Morse!</span></p>
	<h2>Article Control</h2>
<p>Each time an RSS feed is read, it supplies a bunch of &quot;recent&quot; articles. RSS Morse has some filtering to prevent the same articles from being seen &quot;too often&quot;. That's what the <strong>Story Age</strong> setting does. The default setting of 120 (minutes) means the same story won't be sent via Morse unless it hasn't been seen for two hours. The Clear Cache button immediately deletes all to the &quot;seen&quot; titles instead of waiting for each to expire. </p>
<p>The <strong>Poll Interval</strong> sets the time (minutes) between fetches of the articles from the RSS feed. If you set this to many minutes, you'll get large batches of messages in Morse at once (like when the Start button is first clicked). If you set this to a short interval like 5 minutes, you'll tend to get small batches of messages more or less in real time. </p>
	<h2>Morse Code Control</h2>
	<p>Besides the obvious selector for International versus American Morse code, you can also control the speed (words per minute). The generated American Morse code has timing nuances that should make it sound quite natural. Timing of American code is much more &quot;human&quot;. Thanks to Les Kerr (the <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~morsekob/" target="_parent">MorseKOB</a> author) for the algorithms that make American code sound natural to experienced landline telegraphers.</p>
	<p>The <strong>Timing Comp</strong> setting needs some explanation: On slower systems, the sound player takes some time to start up. This time adds to the computed time between &quot;mark&quot; symbols. The effect on a slower system is that the spaces between the dits and dahs will be too long. The Timing Comp setting sets the number of milliseconds that will be subtracted from the spaces between the dits and dahs, allowing for the sound player latency. On a fast system 0 or 1 will be fine. You may need to set 8 or more on a slow notebook, or even more on a dog-slow netbook.</p>
	<h2>Sound Output</h2>
	<p>You can select to have radio tone or telegraph sounder output. Besides changing the type of sound made, this selection also changes the format of the Morse Code output. Telegraph sounds cause the output messages (e.g., news summaries) to be in the format of a telegram with old-fashioned date/time. Radio tones cause the messages to be in the format of a radio message. </p>
	<p>If you select Radio Tone, clicking the up and down arrow in the <strong>Tone Freq</strong>. box will play a short tone at the new frequency. If you select Telegraph Sounder, you can cycle through the 7 available sounder sounds in the same way.</p>
	<h2>Connecting an External Sounder</h2>
	<p>First you need to make up an interface circuit which uses the serial port's Request to Send (RTS) pin to control the current loop that drives the sounder. You can find out more at Les Kerr's <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~morsekob/morsekob.htm#AppendixD" target="_blank">MorseKOB tutorial Appendix D</a>, and at the <a href="http://www.mrx.com.au/images/cwcom_help.htm#Morse Key Cable" target="_blank">end of the CW Communicator manual</a>. Once you have the sounder interface connected, in RSS Morse, select your COM port and click the little blank button to the right of the Use check box. Your sounder should click/clack 4 times. If this works, you're all set. Check the <strong>Use</strong> box, and you'll see the sound output items become disabled. Morse will be sent only to your external sounder.</p>
