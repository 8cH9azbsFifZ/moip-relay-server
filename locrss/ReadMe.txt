RSS to Morse - Initial Release (testing)
23-Apr-2010

Installing:
----------

Create a folder RSSMorse under Program Files
Put the two files RSSMorse.exe and DC3.MorseEncode.dll into the folder
Create a shortcut on your desktop and/or Start Menu area

Running:
-------

It should be mostly self-evident. Hover the mouse over the controls for more info. Note that the Feed URL selector is pre-filled with some Yahoo! News RSS feeds, and one from my site that gives random words from the 100 most frequently used words in the English Language. As you use new feed URLs, the oldest ones will be deleted once 8 feeds are remembered in the list. I suggest you use the Yahoo News RSS feeds as their format is well suited for turning into "radio messages" or "telegrams". 

I have no way to test the external sounder (via COM port) logic. If it works, that's great!!!

I should have put an "about" function into it, but I just thought of it. I'll eventually do it (before I release it publicly). I'll also make up a proper installer.

Enjoy!!
