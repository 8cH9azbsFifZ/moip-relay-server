Brief notes for initial SourceForge commit 02-Mar-2010

Info and downloads for the CW Communicator itself are at http://www.mrx.com.au/d_cwcom.htm

The cwrss project is the one that builds the robot. It can be run interactively or installed as a Windows Service with InstallUtil. It depends on morse and cwcom projects.

The morse project is a fully documented and more or less completed class for generating Morse code in various forms (including CwCom binary) from text. Check out the CHM file in the doc subdirectory (it was build with Sandcastle and Sandcastle Help File Builder).

The cwcom project is a class which implements the CwCom UDP protocol and packetization.

The ionosphere project implements a CwCom "Ionosphere" server and "who's using me" web site. The web server is built into the ionosphere program. It can be run interactively (shell) or as a Windows Service installed with InstallUtil. This is equivalent to the morsecode.dyndns.org server being run by MRX SOftware.

The test project contains a set of unit tests written for the NUnit test tool - see http://www.nunit.org/
