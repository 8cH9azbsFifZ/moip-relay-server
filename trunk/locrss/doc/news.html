	<p>Morse News periodically reads one <em>or more</em> <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/sitemap/" target="_blank">RSS</a> (news), <a href="http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/APNewsFeeds" target="_blank">Atom</a> (news), and/or <a href="http://twitter.com/" target="_blank">Twitter</a> feeds and translates the received messages into International or American Morse Code, which is output as CW radio tones, or telegraph sounder click/clack sounds, or to a physical telegraph sounder connected to a serial port. This  document will hopefully be all you need to get going. <span class="underline">You'll miss out on important features if you skip reading this</span>!</p>
	<p><span class="yellowbg">Hover the mouse over the controls on the window to get hints on what they do.</span></p>
	<p><span class="yellowbg">If the program crashes when trying to make sounds, you probably can't use it as it requires Microsoft DirectX</span>.</p>
	<h2>Quick Start</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Select the &quot;topstories&quot; RSS feed URL.</li>
		<li>Set the code speed you want.</li>
		<li>Select Tone, Spark Gap, or Sounder.</li>
		<li>Select International or American code.</li>
		<li>Click Start and you should start to hear the Morse code for Yahoo! top stories.</li>
	</ol>
	<p class="alert"><strong>Please Note:</strong> Before writing off Twitter, please read the <a href="#twit">Twitter section</a> below. You can create a separate dedicated Twitter account for use as a news feed then have it follow commercial news services' tweets.</p>
<h2><img src="big_rss.png" alt="RSS" width="32" height="32" hspace="8" align="absmiddle">RSS and Atom News Feeds and URLs</h2>
	<p>RSS and Atom feeds are similar and Morse News understands both formats automatically. These feeds contain digests of articles, most often news articles. It's beyond the scope of this document to describe these feed technologies, how to use them, how to find  feeds, etc. Start with the Wikipedia articles on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS" target="_blank">RSS</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(standard)" target="_blank">Atom</a> if you want detailed info and go from there. Morse News was tested with Yahoo! RSS News feeds. It comes pre-set with several of these feeds. The Yahoo! feeds are clean copies of Associated Press, Reuters, etc. news wire services, not cluttered with junk and verbal decoration. I suggest you start with these. The Feed URL list is pre-filled with a few Yahoo! RSS feeds and a &quot;Top 100 words&quot; practice feed from my web site. Of course you can type in your own URLs. If you actually <em>use</em> a feed you typed in, it will be remembered in the list. Up to the latest 16 feeds used are remembered. <span class="alert">If you want to reset the list to the original set, right click and select <strong>Reset to original list</strong></span>.</p>
	<h3>RSS and Atom Feeds</h3>
	<p>There's sort of an art to discovering the actual feed URL for RSS and Atom feeds. Sometimes it's enough to right-click on the RSS/Atom icon and select Copy Link or Copy Shortcut (depending on your browser). Looking at the bottom status area of your browser while hovering over a feed icon is another trick. Here are some news-type  sources:</p>
	
	<p><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/sitemap/" target="_blank"><strong>Yahoo! News</strong></a> - These are clean news feeds from Reuters, AP, and others and they result in clean telegraphic news.<br>
		<strong><a href="http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/APNewsFeeds" target="_blank">Associated Press</a></strong> - Essential news from AP. There are over a dozen categorized feeds<br>
		<a href="http://www.reuters.com/tools/rss" target="_blank"><strong>Reuters</strong></a> - British newswire service, more world-oriented than the above services<br>
		<strong><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/index.html" target="_blank">The New York Times</a></strong> - Over two dozen news feeds of all types. Somewhat biased but well written. <br>
		<a href="http://www.upi.com/rss/" target="_blank"><strong>United Press International</strong></a> - The classic newswire service.<br>
		<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/rss/" target="_blank"><strong>The CBC News Network</strong></a> - Canadian Broadcasting Corporation world and Canada-oriented news. Works well for Morse messages.<br>
		<a href="http://www.cnn.com/services/rss/" target="_blank"><strong>CNN News</strong></a> - These work well in Morse News.<br>
		<strong><a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/Design/page/feeds.html" target="_blank">The Register</a></strong> - British crazy tabloid style reporting on information technology, tech hardware, etc. Challenging for Morse reading becuse of the unusual writing style. <br>
		<strong><a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/rssindex" target="_blank">Yahoo! Finance</a></strong> - Markets, companies, and commentary from one of Yahoo!'s best services. You can even get feeds on individual stocks.
	</p>
	<p><span class="yellowbg">Not all  feeds will be usable in Morse News!</span></p>

<h3>Feeding From Your Facebook Home</h3>

<p>To get the RSS feed for your Facebook &quot;home&quot;:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Along the top of your Facebook page, in the blue bar, the globe icon is where you see your notifications. Click the globe and at the bottom select <strong>see all notifications</strong>.</li>
	<li>At the top of the Your Notifications page that appears, see <span style="color:gray">Get notifications via:</span> <span style="color: blue">RSS</span>. The <span style="color:blue">RSS</span> is a hyperlink to your Facebook RSS feed. As usual, right click and select Copy Link or Copy Shortcut (depending on your browser).</li>
</ol>
	<h2><a name="twit"></a><a href="http://twitter.com/" target="_blank"><img src="twitter_logo.png" alt="Twitter" width="140" height="62" border="0" align="absmiddle"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Using Twitter to Feed Morse News</h2>
	<p>You can monitor your Twitter timeline (and <em>much</em> more) with Morse News. Assuming you have a Twitter account, all you have to do to monitor your home timeline is use a Feed URL of <span class="fixed">twitter://timeline</span>. You'll notice that this is one of the default items in the Feed URL dropdown list. Try it! The first time you do, you'll see a web browser open to allow you to authorize Morse News to access your Twitter account. This happens only once. <span class="alert">Please note that Morse News asks <strong>only for read access</strong> to your Twitter account. It cannot possibly post tweets or make any changes</span>.</p>
<h3>Why Twitter? It's an excellent way to get news!</h3>
<p>Even if you don't	use Twitter, it's a useful way to get news of multiple specialized topics. There are a couple of ways to do this:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Set up a special Twitter account just for Morse News. Then &quot;follow&quot; one or more Twitter timelines like <a href="http://twitter.com/nasa" target="_blank">@NASA</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/FoxBusiness" target="_blank">@Reuters</a>, or <a href="http://twitter.com/dxzone" target="_blank">@dxzone</a>. Most interesting Twitter timelines are low-bandwidth so follow more than one to get a decent amount of traffic. Once you've set this Twitter account up and have followed your choices, use the simple Feed URL of <span class="fixed">twitter://timeline</span> to read the traffic in Morse Code.</li>
	<li><a href="http://support.twitter.com/articles/76460-how-to-use-twitter-lists" target="_blank">Create a list</a> of news feeds in your existing Twitter account. Visit each Twitter news source (or whatever) and add them to your list. Then use the (advanced) Feed URL of <span class="fixed">twitter://list?name=mylist</span> to read the tweets from the sources in your list. The disadvantage of this approach is that all of this news will also appear in your home timeline. </li>
</ol>
<h3>Advanced Twitter Features and Feed URLs</h3>
<p>The Twitter reader in Morse News supports many forms of Feed URLs which can be used to feed various kinds of information from Twitter:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>twitter://timeline</dt>
	<dd>The home timeline</dd>
	<dt>twitter://user</dt>
	<dd>Your tweets only</dd>
	<dt>twitter://user?screen_name=abcdefg</dt>
	<dd>The tweets of the user whose screen name is <strong>abcdefg</strong>.</dd>
	<dt>twitter://public</dt>
	<dd>The public timeline. This is typically extremely busy and full of junk.</dd>
	<dt>twitter://mentions</dt>
	<dd>Tweets which contain a mention of you</dd>
	<dt>twitter://list?list_name=mylist</dt>
	<dd>Timeline produced from your saved list named <strong>mylist</strong></dd>
	<dt>twitter://list?screen_name=abcdefg&amp;list_name=alist</dt>
	<dd>Timeline produced from the <em>public</em> list <strong>alist</strong> of user <strong>abcdefg</strong></dd>
	<dt>twitter://messages</dt>
	<dd>Your direct messages (as opposed to tweets)</dd>
	<dt>twitter://search?query=xyzzy</dt>
	<dd>A timeline resulting from a Twitter search with search term <strong>xyzzy</strong>. Useful for feeding trending topics via hashtags like <strong>#astronomy</strong> or <strong>#justinbieber</strong>.</dd>
	<dt>twitter://search?query=#morsecode&amp;result_type=popular</dt>
	<dd>A timeline resulting from a Twitter search for hashtag <strong>#morsecode</strong>, and returning only <strong>popular</strong> tweets. The choices for <strong>result_type</strong> are <strong>popular</strong>, <strong>recent</strong>, and <strong>mixed</strong> (containing both).</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Multiple Feeds - Aggregation</h2>
<p>To make things even more interesting, you can read multiple RSS, Atom, and Twitter feeds, combining all of their articles into an aggregated feed. Instead of putting a single feed URL into the field, you put the URL of a local file which contains a <strong>list of feed URLs</strong> (you can mix<strong> http://</strong> for RSS/Atom and <strong>twitter://</strong>). Clicking the <strong>Get Feed List</strong> button opens a file browser with which you can select the feed list file (type of <strong>.txt</strong>). For example:</p>
<pre>;
; Morse News feed list for Joe Mama
;
http://rss.upi.com/news/news.rss
http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_crime.rss
twitter://timeline                          ; My home timeline<br>twitter://messages                          ; My direct messages (PVT)
</pre>
<p>When you select the feed list file in the file browser, you'll notice that a <strong>file:// </strong>URL appears in the Feed URL field, and the file has a type of <strong>.txt</strong>. <span class="alert">If you enter a <strong>file://</strong> URL of a file of type <strong>.xml</strong>, it is assumed to contain RSS or Atom info, which will be fed. You can put one of these into a feed list file!</span><br>
</p>
<h2>Article Control</h2>
<p>Each time a feed (or a set of feeds) is read, it supplies a bunch of &quot;recent&quot; articles. <span class="underline">They are sorted newest to oldest</span>. Morse News has some filtering to prevent the same articles from being seen &quot;too often&quot;. That's what the <strong>Story Age</strong> setting does. The default setting of 120 (minutes) means the same story won't be sent via Morse unless it hasn't been seen for two hours. The <strong>Clear Cache</strong> button immediately deletes all to the &quot;seen&quot; titles instead of waiting for each to expire. </p>
<p>The <strong>Poll Interval</strong> sets the time (minutes) between fetches of the articles from the  feed(s). If you set this to many minutes, you'll get possibly large batches of messages at once (like when the Start button is first clicked). If you set this to a short interval like 5 minutes, you'll tend to get small batches of messages more or less in real time.	</p>
<h2>Morse Code Control</h2>
<p>Besides the obvious selector for International versus American Morse code, you can also control the speed (words per minute). The generated American Morse code has timing nuances that should make it sound quite natural. Timing of American code is much more &quot;human&quot;. Thanks to Les Kerr (the <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~morsekob/" target="_parent">MorseKOB</a> author) for the algorithms that make American code sound natural to experienced landline telegraphers.	</p>
	<h3>Split-Speed (Farnsworth) Timing</h3>
	<p>There are separate controls for code speed (the overall WPM rate) and character speed (the wpm equivalent at which the characters are sent). By setting the character speed higher than the word speed, additional space is inserted between characters and words. This is useful when learning Morse Code. The split-speed timing for International Morse mode is precise, the Code Speed really sets the actual overall &quot;PARIS&quot; (also &quot;MORSE&quot; by the way!) algorithm words-per-minute, even when the character speed is set higher. For American Morse, the Code WPM will not be precise. The split speed timing algorithm is a tradeoff between complexity (and interpretation) and accuracy. Just adjust each speed to your liking and don't put too much faith in the actual WPM read from the Code Speed control.</p>
	<p class="note">NOTE: You can set the speed controls as high as 60 WPM. The program will produce precise timing on most computers at or below 35 WPM. Above that, you're on your own. For telegraph sounder audio, as well as with real sounders, results above 35 WPM will probably be unsatisfactory.</p>
	<h2>Sound Output</h2>
	<p>You can select to have CW radio tone, old-time CW spark gap tone, or telegraph sounder output. <span class="alert">Selecting <strong>Telegraph Sounder</strong> also changes the format of the Morse Code output</span>. Telegraph sounds cause the output messages (e.g., news summaries) to be in the format of a telegram with old-fashioned date/time. <strong>CW Radio Tone</strong> and <strong>CW Spark Gap </strong>cause the messages to be in the format of a radio message. </p>
	<p>If you select <strong>CW Radio Tone</strong>, clicking the up and down arrow in the <strong>Tone Freq</strong>. box will play a short tone at the new frequency. If you select <strong>CW Spark Gap</strong> you can cycle through the available spark gap sounds. If you select <strong>Telegraph Sounder</strong>, you can cycle through the available sounder sounds in the same way.</p>
	<h3>Sound Options &amp; Selecting the Sound Output Device</h3>
	<p>On the main window there is a little hyperlink <span class="underline">Sound cfg</span>. This opens the Sound Settings window where you can select the Windows sound device that is used for audio output and the CW tone envelope rise and fall times. In addition, you can add noise to the output to simulate receiving with static/QRN. Note that version 2.3 and later support only DirectX sound output, therefore your sound card/device must support DirectX or the program cannot be used. If you want to use a sound output device (&quot;sound card&quot;) other than the one currently selected in Windows, you can select it in the dropdown list. To use the one selected in Windows, select <strong>Primary Sound Driver</strong>.</p>
<h2>Using a Real Telegraph Sounder</a></h2>

<p>First you need to make up an interface circuit which uses the serial port's Request to Send (RTS) pin to control the current loop that drives the sounder. You can find out more at Les Kerr's <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~morsekob/morsekob.htm#AppendixD" target="_blank">MorseKOB tutorial Appendix D</a>, and at the <a href="http://www.mrx.com.au/images/cwcom_help.htm#Morse Key Cable" target="_blank">end of the CW Communicator manual</a>. Once you have the sounder interface connected, in Morse News, select your COM port and click the little blank button to the right of the Use check box. Your sounder should click/clack 4 times. If this works, you're all set. Check the <strong>Use</strong> box, and you'll see the sound output items become disabled. Morse will be sent only to your external sounder.</p>

<h3>USB Adapters (thanks again to Les Kerr for this)</h3>
<p>USB-to-serial adapter cables have a reputation for being "quirky", and

that's been my experience too.&nbsp; Morse News requires good performance

on the RS232 control lines (specificall RTS), whereas it doesn't

use the serial data lines at all.&nbsp; Consequently, a product that performs

well for general applications may not be suitable for use with this program.</p>

<p>I've had good luck with two adapter products.&nbsp; My favorite is the

13-inch Port Authority USB Serial DB9 Adapter Cable, made by <b>Cables To Go</b>

(product #26886).&nbsp; I like it because it's economical, compact, and

convenient. Another product that has worked well for me is the <b>Radio Shack</b>

USB-to-Serial Port Cable (catalog #26-183).&nbsp; It's more expensive than the

Cables to Go model and it's a bit bulkier, but it does have the potential

advantage of being readily available at local Radio Shack stores.</p>
<p>If you have a desktop computer with no serial port, an alternative to the USB
	
	adapter is to install a serial port card in one of the computer's spare PCI
	
	slots.&nbsp; I bought a <b>StarTech</b> 2 Port 16550 Serial PCI Card, model
	
	number PCI2S550.&nbsp; It took just a few minutes to open my computer, plug in
	
	the new card, and install the device driver software.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Sounder Driver</h3>
<p>In order to drive an external sounder from the serial port, you'll need an interface circuit like the one shown below.&nbsp; The circuit can be built from parts available at Radio Shack for about $6. The components can even be made to fit inside a DB9 serial port connector, although you may prefer to build it in a project box.</p>

	<h2>Advanced Settings</h2>
	<p>There are several things that cannot be controlled through user controls, but instead must be set via editing the program's configuration file. This is located in the same folder as the program, ans is called <strong>MorseNews.exe.config</strong>. This is an XML file and must be edited carefully! The following settings can be changed via editing this file:</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>IgnoreRetweets</dt>
		<dd>Normally <strong>True</strong>, this controls whether tweets containing &quot; RT @&quot; are suppressed. These re-tweets are commonly off-topic for the person/service you're following. If you want them, change the <strong>True</strong> to <strong>False</strong>.</dd>
		<dt>BreakTime</dt>
		<dd>The time between morse code messages, in seconds. Normally this is 5 seconds. You can change this to modify the quiet interval between successive messages.</dd>
		<dt>DebugTracing</dt>
		<dd>Normally <strong>False</strong>, this turns on the extensive debug tracing in MorseNews when set to <strong>True</strong>. See the next section.</dd>
	</dl>
	<h2>Debug Tracing</h2>
	<p>If the advanced setting <strong>DebugTracing</strong> is set to <strong>True</strong>, the program will send quite a bit of tracing information to the Windows diagnostic tracing system. The easiest and most flexible way to monitor the tracing information is to use the free <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896647" target="_blank">SysInternals DebugView tool</a>. </p>
