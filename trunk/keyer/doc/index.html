	<p>Morse Keyer is a software keyer that can output CW radio tones, old-fashioned telegraph sounder sounds, or drive a device via a serial port (a physical telegraph sounder or ham rig). This  document will hopefully be all you need to get going.</p>
	<p><span class="yellowbg">Hover the mouse over the controls on the window to get hints on what they do.</span></p>
<p><span class="yellowbg">If the program crashes when trying to make sounds, you probably can't use it as it requires Microsoft DirectX</span>.</p>
<h2>Keying Inputs</h2>
<p>The keyer can be keyed with left and right mouse buttons and/or an iambic keyer attached to a serial port (via the CTS and DSR signals). </p>
<h2>Keyer Mode</h2>
<p>The keyer has two straight-key and iambic (&quot;squeeze&quot;) paddles. The straight key mode is simple, it produces sound in response to key or paddle presses. Either paddle will work. </p>
<p>The iambic mode is normally the &quot;B&quot; mode, which adds a trailing element if the paddle is released &quot;early&quot;. Most people prefer this mode. Mode &quot;A&quot; can be selected if you're used to it. For more info on iambic keying, see <a href="K7QO_Iambic_Paddle.pdf" target="_blank">Using an Iambic Paddle by Chuck Adams, K7QO</a> and <a href="modeab.pdf">What's all this iambic keyer mode A and B stuff, anyhow?</a> The code speed control uses the so-called &quot;PARIS&quot; (or &quot;MORSE&quot;) method to establish dit and dah lengths. </p>
<h3>Connecting a Paddle via a Serial Port</h3>
<p>See the directions at Les Kerr's <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~morsekob/morsekob.htm#AppendixB" target="_blank">MorseKOB Tutorial Appendix B</a> or at the <a href="http://www.mrx.com.au/images/cwcom_help.htm#Morse Key Cable" target="_blank">end of the CW Communicator manual</a>.</p>
<h2>Sound Output</h2>
<p>You can select to have CW radio tone or telegraph sounder output, or have the keyer drive an external device such as a telegraph sounder or ham rig. If you select <strong>CW Radio Tone</strong>, clicking the up and down arrow in the <strong>Tone Freq</strong>. box will play a short tone at the new frequency. If you select <strong>Telegraph Sounder</strong>, you can cycle through the available sounder sounds in the same way.</p>
<p>At speeds above 30 wpm, the telegraph sounds can start to sound mushy. This is a limitation in the speed of the sound playing in Windows.</p>
	<h3>Connecting an External Telegraph Sounder</h3>
	<p>First you need to make up an interface circuit which uses the serial port's Request to Send (RTS) pin to control the current loop that drives the sounder. You can find out more at Les Kerr's <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~morsekob/morsekob.htm#AppendixD" target="_blank">MorseKOB tutorial Appendix D</a>, and at the <a href="http://www.mrx.com.au/images/cwcom_help.htm#Morse Key Cable" target="_blank">end of the CW Communicator manual</a>. Once you have the sounder interface connected, in RSS Morse, select your COM port and click the little blank button to the right of the Use check box. Your sounder should click/clack 4 times. If this works, you're all set. Check the <strong>Use</strong> box, and you'll see the sound output items become disabled. Morse will be sent only to your external sounder.</p>

	<p>The original spark gap sound is thanks to John S. Belrose on <a href="http://www.hammondmuseumofradio.org/spark.html" target="_blank">The sounds of a Spark Transmitter: Telegraphy and Telephony</a>. I did some audio processing to create the lower pitch sounds.</p>
