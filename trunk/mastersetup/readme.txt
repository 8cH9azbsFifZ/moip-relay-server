Morse Code Tools V2.2
=====================

Version 2.2 brings you the following bug fixes and improvements to Morse News and Morse Keyer:

- Both Morse News and Keyer allow selecting the sound output device ("sound card") to use, if desired.

- Morse News now requires DirectX for sound. The old legacy support has been removed.

- The keyer's hand-key (manual) sending now has a shaped envelope for key-up.

_ The keyer now has control of the tone envelope rise/fall times.
