Morse Code Tools V2.3
=====================

Version 2.3 is a quick update after 2.2, and together they bring you the following bug fixes and improvements to Morse News and Morse Keyer:

- Both Morse News and Keyer allow selecting the sound output device ("sound card") to use, if desired.

- The keyer now has control of the tone envelope rise/fall times.

- The shapes of the tone envelope leading and trailing edges are now raised-cosine instead of straight ramp.

- The keyer's hand-key (manual) sending now has a shaped envelope for key-up.

- Morse News now requires DirectX for sound. The old legacy support has been removed.
