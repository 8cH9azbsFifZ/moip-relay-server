Morse Code Tools V2.4
=====================

Cumulative changes since Version 2.1: Version 2.4 brings Atom feed capabiity to Morse News, allowing you to take feeds from the Associated Press and other sources that were previously unavailable since they were not RSS.

- Both RSS and Atom feeds are now supported. This makes it possible to use feeds from the Associated Press and other Atom-only sources.

- Both Morse News and Keyer allow selecting the sound output device ("sound card") to use, if desired.

- The keyer now has control of the tone envelope rise/fall times.

- The shapes of the tone envelope leading and trailing edges are now raised-cosine instead of straight ramp. This provides a more spectrally pure (free of harmonics) tone output.

- The keyer's hand-key (manual) sending now has a shaped envelope for key-up.

- Morse News now requires DirectX for sound. The old legacy support has been removed.
